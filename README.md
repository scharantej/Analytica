### Flask Application Design

Here is the design of a Flask application to assist with your research on AI, machine learning, and analytics:

**HTML Files**

- `index.html`: This is the main page of the application. It should provide a brief overview of the application, including information about AI, machine learning, and analytics.
- `research.html`: This page should contain a form that allows users to enter a research query. The form should include fields for the user to enter keywords, select a research topic, and choose the type of results they want (e.g., articles, videos, etc.).
- `results.html`: This page should display the results of the research query. The results should be displayed in a clear and concise manner, with links to the original sources.

**Routes**

- `/`: This route should render the `index.html` page.
- `/research`: This route should render the `research.html` page.
- `/results`: This route should handle the form submission from the `research.html` page and render the `results.html` page with the results of the research query.

**Additional Features**

In addition to the basic functionality described above, the application could also include additional features such as:
- A database of AI, machine learning, and analytics resources.
- A forum where users can discuss research topics and share ideas.
- A blog where experts can write articles about the latest advances in AI, machine learning, and analytics.

I hope this design meets your needs. Please let me know if you have any other questions.
